Watchout is a utility and moderation bot for Discord servers, designed for and with large servers and flexibility in mind.

A plugin based Discord bot looking forward to add more and more plugins over time! *(hopfully with the help of contributors)*

# Current Plugins
- Moderation
- Utility
- Message Logs
- Moderation Logs

*And more being added soon*

We feel that this Discord bot is not required for servers with under 2K members but if you think your server could use Watchout, feel free to selfhost *(just include the credits ty)*
